        Gluten Free Baking
    </h1>
    <p>
        I have always had a passion for baking but since I have had to go Gluten free last year I thought I would have to stop baking.  The reason being is that a lot of gluten free mixes aren't that great and the result usually results in something that is similar to a rock.  So I'm trying out different flour mixes and binders so see what works the best, and if I develop a recipe that is worth sharing I'll post it here.  Also I'll put some random thoughts here relating to what I'm trying out from time to time.
