                    <p>
                        I'm currently redesigning the website to be more modern.  The cover page is the first step.  It will be happening over the next few weeks.

                        I was very late getting into website development.  So be cause of that I'm making up for it now.  This site isn't built of a drag and drop HTML editor.  This is all writing HTML code from scratch in a text editor.  I find it more fun this way and it is a good learing experience in HTML.  So far no JavaScript exists but that may change as I get more adventurous.  I may even leverage some more of AWS's free offering as learning opportunities for learning.
                    </p>

                        If you are interesting in setting up your own personal website but don't know where to start let me know.  My experience is hosting from AWS (since its free) but if prefer other providers (e.g. Squarespace) then I might be able to help.  Note that costs may apply with other providers.

                        I have some big thank yous to companies (not a sponsor) which allowed me to set up my website.  First of all DomaiNZ for the URL registration and Amazon Web Services for hosting the site and for the build/deplyment pipeline setup.
