        With the COVID-19 lockdown level 4 happening in New Zealand my usual busy life has been turned upside down.  So since my usual busy scedule has been put on hold for a while I thought I would look at doing some website design in my spare time.  I'm still able to work from home but it is after work when I need something to fill my time in.
    </p>
    <p>
        The aim is to create a website using no layout tools and code it all manually using HTML5, CSS3, and AngularJS (when needed).  So check back over the coming weeks and see how my site is going.
    </p>

        In the mean time even though I'm in my bubble with my amazing wife I'll put down a list of organisations I'm either involved with and hobbies which I will be expanding upon later.
